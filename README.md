Project:Cat vs Dog Image Classification using CNN

1. Problem Statement:
The project is about building a machine learning model that can automatically classify images into two categories: Cat or Dog. Instead of humans looking at an image and saying
"This is a cat" or "This is a dog," we make a computer learn these patterns by itself.

2. Dataset:
The dataset contains thousands of images of cats and dogs.
These images are divided into:
Training set → used to teach the model (the model learns patterns of cats and dogs here).
Validation set → used to check if the model is learning correctly while training.
Testing set → used to test the model after training and see how well it performs on unseen data.

3. Preprocessing:
Before feeding images to the model:
Images are resized (e.g., 150×150 pixels) so they are uniform in shape.
Pixel values are normalized (divided by 255) so they fall between 0 and 1, which helps the model learn faster.
Data augmentation (rotation, zoom, flip, shear, etc.) is applied to create variations of images, making the model more robust.

4. Model (CNN Architecture):
The core of the project is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
CNNs are powerful because they can automatically detect important features like:
Edges
Shapes
Patterns

Structure of the model:
Convolution Layers → extract features like ears, eyes, fur patterns.
Pooling Layers → reduce size while keeping important info.
Flatten Layer → convert 2D features into 1D vector.
Dense Layers → fully connected layers that make the decision.
Output Layer → uses sigmoid activation to give probability:

Close to 0 → Cat
Close to 1 → Dog

5. Training
The training process goes through epochs (iterations).
In each epoch, the model sees all training images and adjusts its weights to improve accuracy.
Loss function measures error, and optimizer improves the model step by step.
Validation accuracy is checked to avoid overfitting.

6. Testing / Prediction:
After training:
A new image (say, "cat1.jpg") is given.
The model processes the image and predicts whether it’s a cat or a dog.

Example:
If the output probability > 0.5 → Dog
Else → Cat

7. Results:
The model can classify unseen images with good accuracy.
You can show accuracy/loss graphs for training vs validation.
It demonstrates deep learning’s ability to handle image recognition tasks.
